functions:
1) realpoint(int i ,float x,float y,float z): 
to add the points in directly without propmt
int: point no.


2) reset()
to reset the point matrix after every operation

3) display(float a, float b)

a=     1=front view :: 2= side view:: 3=top view 
b =    1=join by line  :: 2= directly draw a point cloud

4) iso()

generates isometric view

5) rotate(float a,float b)
a = 1: about z axis :: 2=about x axis :: 3=about y axis
b = angle in DEGREE

6) translat(float x,float y,float z)
translate the object

7) mirror(float a)
mirror 
a=1 abt x axis
a= 2 abt y xis
a= 3 abt z axis

8) shear(float a,float b)
a = in which direction values same as above
b = shearing factor


9) scale(float a,float b)
same as bove but for scaling


10) takpoint()
manual one after another inpit of point with prompt to user. use for 3D object joined by streight line

11) void startgraph()
to initialise graphics


12) ******important*******
create object of class transform with number of points as parameter.
e.g.
transfrom m(100);
means m is object now with 100 points in it to operate with.
